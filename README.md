### Survey Project Client README

## Survey Says
Developers created a survey application (one user to many surveys and many responses) - it would be conceptualized as a place for people to CREATE a surveys, view all surveys they and others have created, UPDATE the survey and DELETE their own surveys.

## Scope of Project
* Design and implement API
* Design and implement client
* Deploy apps
* Make API for front end and back end
* Make a repository for both front end and back end via heroku and github

## Links to Live & Front/Back End Repositories
* Front-End Repo:
* Back-End Repo:
* Deployed Front-End:
* Deployed Back-End:

## Technologies Used
Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, and Handlebars

## Work flow - Planning and Development
1.) The team developed an ERD of the one user to many surveys and responses diagram
2.) Wrote user stories (link is below):
2a.) For authorizations
2b.) For creating, viewing, updating and deleting their surveys.
3.) Created a wireframe the user
experience and interface (view link below)
4.) Utilized notes taken from General Assembly and external resources
5.) Worked on the back end and front end
6.) The process entailed working on one part of a feature (e.g.
sign up), then test.
7.) Add and commit upon completion of a successful feature
8.) Push to the remote repository
9.) Any issues would utilize outside sources (notes, google, then General Assembly issue queue)

## Problem-Solving
* Used online resources such as StackOverflow to investigate ways to resolve issues
* Used console.log to pinpoint issues and debug code
* Discussed issues among group members
* Worked together as much as possible through pair and group programming
* Utilized General Assemblyâ€™s Project Issue queue to request assistance from instructors

## User Stories
* As a new user, I can sign up for the application using an email and password.
* As a signed up user, I can use my credentials to sign in to the application.
* As a signed in user, I can change my password.
* As a signed in user, I can sign out.
* As a signed in user, I can create a new survey.
* As a signed in user, I can update my surveys.
* As a signed in user, I can delete my surveys.
* As a signed in user, I can see all surveys created by me and other users.
* As a signed in user, I can take all surveys created by me and other users.

## Future considerations:
1.) Improve user Interface and experience for target consumer.
2.) Make an optimal interactive experience.
3.) Ensure product is made for market
and consumer fit.
